The goal of this exercise is to build a “Purchase Summary” user interface using React.


## Key UI elements: 
 - The “Pickup savings” tooltip
 - The “See Item details” expander
 - The “Apply Promo code” expander



## Basic setup and running

Download the repo and run `npm install`

`npm start` to startup the application and `npm run test` for running tests.

## What could be better
 - There is room for improving componentization
 - Componetize Style - CSS code can be way better
 - Create Unit tests for reducer/action and improve main container test
 - In a real world project there should be more reducers - use combineReducers
 - a11y
 - Due to the nature of the challenge, there's not responsive work - no need to use @media specific rules
